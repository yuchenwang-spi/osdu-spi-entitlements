# Contributing

This repository is the Azure implementation of an OSDU community service. It tracks the
upstream [OSDU project](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform) and carries the
Azure provider on top.

## Experimental customer fork

`yuchenwang-spi/osdu-spi-entitlements` is a customer fork of
[`Azure/osdu-spi-entitlements`](https://github.com/Azure/osdu-spi-entitlements).
`@yuchen-wang99` owns reviews for this experimental repository.

The default branch retains the upstream review and CI requirements. The owner has an
explicit pull-request-only bypass for experimental merges, including self-authored
pull requests that GitHub does not allow the author to approve. This bypass does not
permit direct or force pushes to `main`.

Customer synchronization uses `SYNC_MODE=mirror`. The reviewer configuration in
`.github/CODEOWNERS` and the bypass in `.github/rulesets/default-branch.json` are
intentional downstream differences. Preserve them when resolving synchronization
conflicts, and keep this fork's governance changes out of upstream feature pull requests.

## Where a change belongs

This tree has three owners; [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) maps the paths.

| Area | Owner | Where to make the change |
|---|---|---|
| `provider/*-azure/`, `testing/*-test-azure/`, `.spi/`, `.github/upstream-filter.yml`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md` | This repository | A pull request here. |
| `.github/` (except the files above), `build/`, `.release-please-config.json` | [`Azure/osdu-spi`](https://github.com/Azure/osdu-spi) | The template. Template sync overwrites these files here. |
| Everything else (shared service code) | OSDU community | Upstream in [OSDU GitLab](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform). To bring in a specific upstream fix early, port it and add the `port` label to the pull request. |

## Making a change

1. Branch from `main` with a type prefix: `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`.
2. Build and test with `mvn clean install`, adding `--settings=.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml` when that file exists, as CI does.
3. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commits and the pull request title; release-please versions from them.
4. Open a pull request against `main`. Merging needs passing CodeQL and validation checks, every review thread resolved, and a code owner's approval.
